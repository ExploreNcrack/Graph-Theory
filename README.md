Exploring graph theory in mathematical way</br>
<h2>Goal</h2>
Modeling problem as a graph is a very important technique in problem solving. Since we can nicely simplify the problem into basic components: nodes(or vertices) and edges, where a node in a graph can represent an object and an edge can represent some sort of relation between the objects. Further more, once we represent the problem as a graph, we can apply the mathematical graph theory(which has lots of nice properties about different kinds of graphs and so on.) to analyze the problem and possibly come up with a effective solution. 
<h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
<strong>In general, by formal definition, a graph is an order triple <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=G%3D%28V%2CE%2C%5Cpsi%29%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="G=(V,E,\psi) " width="101" height="19" />, where V is a non-empty set of vertices(points), E is a set of edges (lines) disjoint from V, and <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%5Cpsi&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="\psi" width="18" height="19" /> is a function that assigns to each edge, a pair of vertices (v,vâ€™).</strong>
