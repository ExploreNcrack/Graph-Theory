# Adjacency List
**An array of lists is used**. **Size** of the array is equal to the **number of vertices**. Let the array be array[]. An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph.
## Pros (Advantage)
- more **space-efficient** way to implement a sparsely connected graph
